# Star attributes (solar power and solar wind). In general, a star either
# provides a lot of solar power or a lot of solar wind (ramscoop recharge rate)
# but not both. That's not realistic, but it creates a more interesting dynamic.

# For convenience, every spectral class (o, b, a, f, g, k, m) has the same variants:
# 0, 3, 5, 8, -dwarf, -giant, and -supergiant

# Main sequence stars.
