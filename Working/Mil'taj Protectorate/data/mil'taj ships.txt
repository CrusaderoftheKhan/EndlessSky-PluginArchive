	description "For when many Avendri needed to be moved from world to world. Used to great effect to move refugees during the purge, since then these large transports have been mostly put aside for evacuation purposes. Armour, weapon space and one awkwardly fitted gun port have been added to this retrofitted civilian vessel."

	description `Found only in the cold expanse east of Mil'taj space, the Ma'korbra are ravenous gargantuan beasts that scavenge the hyperlanes looking for anything emmiting heat, which they are incrediably sensative to. When finding prey they surge forward and tear into armour with ease, devouring everything it can find. Their bite is weaker against shielding, but in their regions of space, that is hardly a problem.`
	description `Their fins collect shards of what seem like coagulated blood, and launch them to coat targets in thick heavy blood to stop prey from being able to easily flee. Interestingly the blood seems to home in on heat sources, though it is unknown how this effect is achieved.`
