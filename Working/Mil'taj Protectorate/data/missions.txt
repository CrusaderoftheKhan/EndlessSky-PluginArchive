			`Descending through the atmosphere you are sent a message to land at the largest spire on the planet, reaching almost 3 kilometres into the sky and bearing over a dozen landing pads for even the largest of ships.`
			`	Upon landing, you are greeted by Mil'taj guards at your landing ramp, and the one in the lead steps forward, a translation device connected to its neck. "Your presence is requested by the High Kalisk's."`
			`	They don’t seem interested in telling you more and proceed to escort you deep into the bowels of the spire which soon open up into a large auditorium where a large number of Mil'taji and Avendri await.`
			`	Other than the guards, all within this chamber seem to have two additional arms, though a small number in elevated seating near the back bear four additional arms and are covered head to toe in cybernetic augmentations. What little discussion was being had is silenced as you enter and one of the four armed Mil'taji stands.`
			`	"Voting of the Kalisk's on the human’s citizenship status shall now begin. Human, make your case to the Mil'taj Protectorate on why you should receive this honour that none outside our two races has ever been given." They don't take much time to get to the point it seems.`

				`	"I have helped your people in numerous ways. Why do I need to list them when my actions can speak for me?"`
			`	The hall fills with discussion as those Mil'taj at the back stare you down, each judging you with an inscrutable gaze.`
			`	It takes ten minutes before the hall is silenced again by a loud chime echoing from the back. "Deliberation has ended and all Kalisk's present have uploaded their vote. Approval has been given. We oldest of the Protectorate declare that this choice is to be honoured and that the human known as Captain <first> <last> shall be an honorary citizen from this day onwards. Do not fail us."`
			`	As the announcement is made, other than some quiet murmurs from the crowd, everyone seems to take the announcement without much fanfare. The guards usher you out of the hall and back to your ship, where a lone Mil'taji awaits – the one who spoke to you the last two times you were here, just without his entourage.`
			`	"Welcome to the Protectorate Captain <last>. My name is Gal'Za, and I shall by the Kalisk assigned to you for the foreseeable future.

			`	They close their arms together and say, "The Mil'taj empire from before was flawed, our people came here to conquer and colonize new worlds, as we had already claimed the whole of our home galaxy. Our people separated servant species into castes, with all below us no matter their abilities nor loyalty."`
			`	Gal'Za continues in a proud tone of voice, "The Protectorate was formed after the great purge as an alliance of the two remaining Avendri worlds and the remnants of our people. Our race knew we could not survive as we had. Keeping those we claim to rule as slaves was foolish when what we needed was loyalty and strength of will. Those ideals are greater than any ideas of racial superiority, and we have been stronger ever since we turned our back on the old ways."`
			`	Taking a moment to calm themselves, they look you in the eyes. "Dedication to the Protectorate, and to our mutual fight for survival is all that truly matters. Perhaps when the war is won and peace reigns, our offspring will see things differently, but for those surviving now, that is the only truth we can rely on."`

			`	"They don't fight for freedom as they are already as free as we can be under the Quarg, and they don't fight for justice as our worlds burned for what we did as punishment for our mistakes.” Their skin ripples violently as the words leave their mouth. “Many of our people must work long and hard to keep us all alive, not just Avendri but Mil'taji as well, but they only see their own working and dying, blind to our burdens and struggles even as we are right beside them.`

			`	Their long mechanical arms flex and twist in the air, "A symbol of office, the more augmented spinal arms you have installed, the higher your rank. A single arm is for soldiers, local leaders, and those who have shown loyalty beyond the norm. Two arms are for Kalisk's like myself, officers, diplomats, and other high ranking figures."`
			`	"Finally we have those with four arms. They are the High Kalisk's, the oldest living Mil'taji and Avendri, and the leaders of the Protectorate. Our people's life spans are three centuries in your years, but augmentation can extend that indefinitely, albeit at exorbitant cost. The High Kalisk's are more machine than organic now, but their minds are still flesh and they have always led us without issue."`
			`	"A single spinal arm requires a tiny amount of material from our home galaxy, meaning each is a treasure and an honour to receive. We discovered Avendri are compatible with the technology after adjustments, but the procedure even with my kind is dangerous, and one in five operations result in failure, inflicting disability or death on the subject. Thus, only those truly willing to serve the Protectorate choose to undertake the procedure."`
			`	"Do you have any other questions?"`
				goto continue
			label translate
			`	"A simple question with a simple answer: we did not. Long before we even entered this galaxy, an artificial mind was created for the sole purpose of understanding the many languages of our subjects. It has always been an important artefact of our people, and it was brought to this galaxy when the Quarg were first encountered.`
			`	"It is sealed deep within this spire, but connected to most computerised systems we maintain to allow it to continually be updated with any deviations our languages may take. Most basic vocal augmentations allow Avendri to Mil'taji translations, but external hardware is required for your unique tongue."`
			`	"Do you have any more questions?"`
				goto continue
			label wormhole
			`	"Our home galaxy was finally subjugated after a series of long bloody wars many thousands of your years ago. The final of these wars was with the Pug, who, rather than lose, fled our galaxy entirely, leaving empty systems and worlds for our people to find."`
			`	"When colonizing this abandoned space, the wormhole to this galaxy suddenly appeared over the Pug's former capital during its colonization."`
			`	"At first, they only sent scouts and the occasional survey fleet to detect any Pug that might have used it to flee, but we only found empty space and a new frontier to claim. Over what I believe to be approximately two millennia of your years, the Mil'taj empire explored and expanded into this Galaxy, limited by the few hyperdrive connections they found, until the Quarg attempted contact."`
			`	"Fighting quickly started. They saw our race as invaders and the empire desired an enemy to fight. At first, the Quarg did little other than skirmish, as their Jumpdrives meant our people could never launch proper attacks. In this time of tension, a young race within a nearby hyperlane network began to colonise systems just as prototype Jumpdrives were developed: the Avendri."`
			`	"The empire struck quickly. New Jumpdrives were used to rapidly conquer the Avendri and prepare the race for subjugation. That’s when the Quarg truly began attacking. Entire worlds were burned, thousands of ships fought bitterly and, despite what you may think, the empire was winning, as our war fleets poured in for this new conflict."`
			`	Gal'Za stops briefly, the skin upon the sides of his face pulling inward in a painful expression, "Then the Drak involved themselves. Our weapons were like toys to them and our greatest ships like grass to be cut. We had lost the minute they entered the conflict, and when the wormhole collapsed, we had nowhere to run."`
			`	He takes another pause before continuing, "The only planets spared were those with a majority Avendri population. All others were stripped of life or erased from the galaxy entirely. Plagues of disease decimated the remaining population, and the Quarg swept in, shattering our few surviving fleets. Today there might be less than a billion Mil'taj in this galaxy, but when we were at our peak, we numbered in the trillions."`
			`	"But that is all history, now. We fight for our future, not the past. Any more questions?"`
				goto continue
			label medical
			`	"A disease we cannot stop nor slow down is eating away at our people. When we first came to your galaxy, our advanced medical technologies allowed us to easily treat the cancerous decay we experienced here, but once the purge happened, many of those supplies were either impossible to replenish or knowledge of how to replicate them was lost. What we can create now is barely able to keep the disease at bay."`
			`	Their skin ripples in violent waves as they continue, "Those of us who have reached old age tend to have a resilience to the disease, but our young are afflicted by it frequently and randomly. Once a single Mil'taji develops the tell-tale tumours, the disease begins to spread like a wave until we can treat all affected, or until there are no more Mil'taji for it to claim."`
			`	"Please ask another question now. I do not wish to talk more of this."`
				goto continue
			label ship
			`	A large toothy smile emerges on Gal'Za's face. "Our race’s ultimate weapon, an Erebus class warship, able to defeat even the Quarg’s mightiest ships. Few remain, as their hulls are formed from a material not native to this galaxy. They are able to weld themselves together even after the most violent of impacts and deadliest of weapons.`
			`	"I have only seen one used in combat twice, each time against Quarg scout ships sent to this system. The footage of its defense of the capital has been used in numerous broadcasts, primarily to show that no matter how strong the Quarg may seem, even they must break and falter against our might. We have not seen them attempt to scout this system in many decades, they may have realised the futility at long last." `
			`	"Do you have another question?"`
				goto continue
			label end
			`	"Hopefully these insights help you understand our plight better, and illustrate how thankful we are that someone without a connection to our conflict has decided to lend us aid. I thought that you would be a great ally for the Protectorate the first time we talked, and that I was proven right, I can only be thankful for."`
			`	Gal'Za grips your shoulders and attempts to mimic a human smile. "I have personally put in a recommendation that, under future supervision, if you prove yourself an even greater asset to our cause, that you are to be granted access to our military technology. Do not let me down."`
			`	They step back, make the open arm gesture you have seen before and leave, allowing you to make your way onto your ship to find your new digital license ready to be used.`

Asala and Karkola, the first High Kalisk’s of our people, led two simultaneous rebellions against the Mil'taj Empire. They defeated our slavers on Avendaria and Savandra in a sudden organised uprising, catching the Mil’taji completely off-guard."`

			`	She waits a moment before continuing.`
			`	"The purge had come so suddenly, our untouched worlds only found out once it had already been completed. The Drak cut hyperlanes and altered the very distances between stars, ensuring the purge was quick and terrifyingly effective. The great empire we had risen to fight was already crushed. The leaders who caused our suffering dead, or participating in a suicidal charge against the Quarg blockades."`
			`	Her beak rattles as she speaks. "And we found that our brothers and sisters, who had been taken from our worlds that we had sought to free. The very ones which the rebellion was built upon, were butchered along with our slavers. Given no chance to escape, the Drak’s efficiency ensured none survived.`
			`	"Our leaders were the best of us, they did not slaughter the survivors for their empires crimes. We took them in, healed them and most importantly, gained their respect and trust. Soon after the Protectorate was formed, the ones who had participated in our suffering were punished, and as a united people we moved to a brighter future."`
			`	"At least, we would have if the Quarg did not continue their violent and pointless war of genocide against those we forgave millennia ago." Siclipia looks into your eyes in silence.`
			`	Suddenly she drops the look letting our a joyful caw. "Apologies if I sounded too grim for a moment. I had to ensure you knew how the average Avendri would feel being asked such an insulting thing. This is all history any Avendri would know, High Kalisk Asala herself still guides us to this day, so the fact some still think the Mil’taji are our enemies is a frustrating fact to many of us."`
			`	"Moving on, I hope that helped with your insight into our people. Any other questions?"`

			`	"I assume you are not asking for the usual, 'they are our comrades in arms' speech. I have my own opinions, but the general consensus is usually mutual respect. The Quarg claim to wish to 'save' us, but they destroy ships filled with Avendri just as often and those with Mil'taji inside."`
			`	She picks some loose feathers from her arms in a lazy gesture. "Some still hold old grudges over how our species were treated in the past. Most of us though, are simply trying to survive in this Quarg made cage."`
			`	"Also of note, every year more Avendri pass the training to be allowed into the military, with almost a third of all ships you see in our space piloted by one of us. `

			`	Siclipia pulls up a panel from the desk and begins typing, before looking back to you. "I can't find anything about a species named that that in our databases. Could you describe them for me?" You give a brief description of the Wanderers and their culture to her as she continues typing.`
			`	"It doesn’t seem like the Mil'taj have ever encountered a species matching that description, but I can understand why you would ask. From your description they seem strikingly similar to ourselves, perhaps we hold some connection to them from ancient times that is unrecorded." Marking something down she closes the panel.`
			`	"I have logged this down as a special inquiry, perhaps someone will be able to find something eventually. Sorry that I couldn't be of more help, do you wish to know anything else?"`

			`	"You are welcome, but I must say something else. While I glossed over some of our problems, they do exist. We struggle to feed everybody, medical talents are monopolised by the Mil'taji, for understandable reasons, and many of cities are dangerous, forcing routine patrols to keep the factories running".`
			`	"Our people suffer under this constant war. Many blame the Mil'taji, most the Quarg, some both. The only difference between them is that one fights alongside us for their own freedom. While the other fights to extinguish an entire race for crimes they have already paid for."`
			`	"Now if that was all you needed. I hope your winds guide you gracefully Captain <last>.`
