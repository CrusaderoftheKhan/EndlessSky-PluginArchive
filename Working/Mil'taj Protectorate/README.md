# Mil'taj Protectorate
Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.

I decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, but a race of aliens from the plugin Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.

This is my attempt to morph the Mil'taj into their own fully functional developed race, with a simple opening mission chain and plenty of lore.

It is recommended to avoid the Mil'taj storyline until you can at least defeat a Wardragon, otherwise you will have a bad time.

ATM you can choose to either align yourself with the Mil'taj against the Quarg, or make them an enemy. I do not plan to ever have a Quarg side to the campaign, they just want you to piss off.


Reccomended Plugins:
